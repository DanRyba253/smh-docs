If the input string is not given, smh gets input from stdin. <command> string The command string consists of two parts, separated by the pipe symbol \"|\"\" The first part is a list of focusers, separated by the dot symbol \".\" The second part is an action. The idea is that we use focusers to nail down on the part of the string that we want to access, and then the action that we want to perform on it. For example: smh 'words|get' \"hello world\" - 'words' focuser focuses on all words within the string, the get action prints them to the screen. How do focusers work? Each focuser in the focuser list can be thought of as a function that takes in a focus and returns a list of new focuses. Each focuser represents a focusing step. During each step, every active focus gets fed into the current focuser and all the new focuses that are produces go to the next step. What is a focus? Focuses can be devided into two groups: Updatable focuses - represent some part of the input string, these can be updated through actions, to get an updated input string. Non-updatable focuses - these represent read-only data, obtained from the input string, and thus can't be updated, only read. Focuses are further divided into two types: Strings - represent string data. Lists - represent lists of sub-focuses. For example the \"words\" focuser takes in a String focus and produces Updatable String focuses for each word in it. At the very start we have one active Updatable String focus which represents the whole input string. For the description of available focusers visit Focuser documentation What is an action? Action is the part of the command string that goes after the pipe symbol. Actions can be used to display parts of input, or change them. For the description of available actions visit Action documentation Focuser documentation id (focuser) \"id\" is the simplest focuser possible, it returns the same focus that was given to it. It can be useful if you want to focus on the whole input string. $ smh 'id|get' \"hello world\" hello world each \"each\" focuses on each element of a List , or every character in a String . $ smh 'each|get' \"hello\" h e l l o words \"words\" focuses on each word within a String . $ smh 'words|get' \"hello world\" hello world lines \"lines\" focuses on every line within the input string. $ printf \"hello\\nworld\" | smh 'lines|get' hello world ws \"ws\" focuses on consequetive strings of whitespace characters. $ smh 'ws.len|get' \"a b c d e\" 4 collecting (%) You can collect all the focuses, produced by a focuser into one List focus, that includes all of them, by using \"%\" $ smh '%words|over reverse' \"hello world my name is Dani\" Dani is name my world hello cols \"cols\" focuses on every column within the input string.
